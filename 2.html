<h2>Chain Technology</h2>
Blockchain is a data forgery prevention technology based on distributed computing technology.<br>
Based on the P2P method, it is a technology that stores managed data in a distributed data storage environment called 'block' formed <br>by connecting small data
countless times in a chain form so that no one can arbitrarily modify it and anyone can read the results of the change.<br>
 The block contains the details of all transactions that were disseminated to users before the block was discovered
